## Project Process

## Teamwork
With this dataset, Fernanda was mostly in charge of SQL queries as she had some beginner experience using PostgreSQL and creating load files. Andrea worked more on creating the visuals with Vega-lite as she had used that language for her previous assignment. Once we had the basic queries and the basic charts made, both of us worked together to translate the Vega-lite charts to Vega-lite using JSON.
